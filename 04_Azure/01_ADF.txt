• Definition:
Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service from Microsoft Azure. 
It allows users to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines that move and transform data 
between different data stores and data processing environments.
ADF doesn't store any data itself. It comes with pre-built connectors, making it a good 
solution for hybrid Extract-Transform-Load (ETL), Extract-Load-Transform (ELT), and other 
Data Integration pipelines. In ADF, users create pipelines in the GUI

• ADF is made up of the following key components: 
Pipelines, Activities, Datasets, Linked services, Data Flows, Integration Runtimes.

• Azure Data Factory Interview Questions and Answer:
1. What is Azure Data Factory (ADF)?
Answer: Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service provided by Microsoft Azure.
It allows you to create, schedule, and manage data pipelines that can move data between supported 
on-premises and cloud-based data stores.

2. Explain the key components of Azure Data Factory.
Answer: The key components of Azure Data Factory include:
Datasets: Represent the data structures within the data stores.
Linked Services: Define the connection information to the data stores.
Pipelines: Logical grouping of activities that perform a task.

3. What is a Linked Service in Azure Data Factory?
Answer: A Linked Service in Azure Data Factory defines the connection information to external data 
sources or destinations. It contains the necessary details like connection strings, authentication 
credentials, and other settings required to connect to the data store.

4. Differentiate between Data Flow and Control Flow in Azure Data Factory.
Answer: Data Flow: It defines the data transformation activities and the flow of data from source to destination. 
It includes transformations such as filter, aggregate, join, and more.
Control Flow: It orchestrates and controls the execution of various activities within the pipeline. 
It includes tasks like data movement, data transformation, and data processing.

5. How can you monitor and manage Azure Data Factory?
Answer: Azure Data Factory provides monitoring through Azure Monitor, where you can view pipeline runs, 
trigger runs manually, and monitor data integration performance. Additionally, you can use Azure Data 
Factory's portal to explore and manage your data pipelines.

6. What is the purpose of the Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory?
Answer: Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory is responsible for the execution of data movement 
and data transformation activities across different network environments. It enables communication between 
Azure Data Factory and supported data stores.

7. How can you parameterize the Azure Data Factory pipeline?
Answer: You can use parameters to make your pipeline dynamic. Parameters allow you to pass values at runtime, 
making it easy to reuse and parameterize the pipeline for different scenarios.

8. Explain the concept of Azure Data Factory triggers.
Answer: Triggers in Azure Data Factory define when a pipeline should be executed. There are two types of 
triggers: Schedule Triggers (based on time) and Event Triggers (based on events like the arrival of new data 
or completion of a previous pipeline run).

9. What are the differences between Azure Data Factory and Azure Logic Apps?
Answer: Azure Data Factory is primarily focused on data integration and ETL processes, moving and transforming 
data. Azure Logic Apps, on the other hand, is designed for workflow automation, allowing you to orchestrate 
and automate processes across different systems and services.

10. Can you deploy Azure Data Factory across multiple regions?
- Answer: Yes, you can deploy Azure Data Factory across multiple regions to ensure high availability and 
resilience. This is achieved by configuring the necessary infrastructure components, such as Integration 
Runtimes, in different Azure regions.

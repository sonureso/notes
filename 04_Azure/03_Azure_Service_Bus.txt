• Definition:
-> Azure Service Bus is a cloud-based messaging service that enables communication between applications, 
devices, and services. It's a fully managed enterprise message broker that uses message queues and 
publish-subscribe topics.
-> Azure Service Bus is used for event-driven data processing, where data is transmitted between 
applications asynchronously. It supports messaging patterns such as publish-subscribe, request-response, 
and queuing. It is optimized for low-latency messaging, with sub-millisecond latency for message delivery. 
It also provides high throughput and low message loss rates.
-> Azure Service Bus is widely used to securely connect distributed applications. It removes the dependency 
between the sender and consumer, and anyone can be taken offline without disturbing the overall communication.
It is a serverless messaging mechanism available in Microsoft Azure. As this is an serverless offering, this 
mechanism provides better efficiency.

• Azure Service Bus interview questions and answers:

1. What is Azure Service Bus?
Answer: Azure Service Bus is a cloud messaging service provided by Microsoft Azure, which enables communication 
between distributed applications and services. It supports messaging patterns such as publish/subscribe, queuing, 
and point-to-point communication.

2. What are the key features of Azure Service Bus?
Answer: Key features of Azure Service Bus include:
Message Queues: Supports reliable messaging using queues.
Topics and Subscriptions: Enables publish/subscribe communication.
Reliable Messaging: Ensures message delivery with at-least-once delivery semantics.
Dead Lettering: Automatically moves failed messages to a dead-letter queue for analysis.

3. Explain the difference between Azure Service Bus Queues and Topics.
Answer: 
Queues: Follows a point-to-point messaging pattern, where a message is delivered to a single consumer.
Topics: Enable publish/subscribe pattern, where messages are sent to a topic and multiple subscribers 
(subscriptions) can receive messages.

4. What is a Brokered Messaging API in Azure Service Bus?
Answer: The Brokered Messaging API in Azure Service Bus provides a higher level of abstraction for 
working with messages. It includes features like transactions, sessions, and sophisticated 
publish/subscribe capabilities.

5. How does Azure Service Bus handle message durability?
Answer: Azure Service Bus ensures message durability through features like message persistence and storage 
redundancy. Messages are persisted to provide reliable delivery, and storage redundancy options 
(Standard or Premium) offer different levels of fault tolerance.

6. What is the purpose of a Dead-Letter Queue in Azure Service Bus?
Answer: The Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) in Azure Service Bus is a queue where messages that cannot be delivered 
successfully are automatically moved. This allows developers to analyze and address the reasons for message 
failures.

7. Explain the concept of Sessions in Azure Service Bus.
Answer: Sessions in Azure Service Bus allow related messages to be grouped together and processed by the 
same consumer. It's useful when there is a need to maintain order or state across a series of related messages.

8. How does Azure Service Bus handle message ordering?
Answer: Azure Service Bus provides ordering at the session level. Messages within a session are guaranteed 
to be processed in the order they are sent. However, this ordering is not guaranteed across different sessions.

9. What is the purpose of the Azure Service Bus Relay?
Answer: The Azure Service Bus Relay allows communication between services across different network boundaries, 
such as between on-premises and cloud environments. It enables secure and seamless communication without 
requiring direct connectivity.

10. How can you secure communication in Azure Service Bus?
Answer: Azure Service Bus supports security features such as Shared Access Signatures (SAS) and Azure Active 
Directory (Azure AD) authentication. These mechanisms ensure secure communication and access control to Service
Bus resources.
